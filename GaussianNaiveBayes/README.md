- A helper function for computing Naive Bayes
- Function that predicts the label based on GNB for a testing dataset based on some targets from a training dataset (ground truth)
- Comparison between my implementation and the implementation from SciKitLearn
- Same comparison, but after some data preprocessing:
    - Removal of outliers with a z-score over 3
    - Removal of duplicates
    - Testing with different training/testing sizes
