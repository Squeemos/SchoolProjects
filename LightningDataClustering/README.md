### Description
This was my sophomore year project working with two students, Alex Herrera and Aeon Williams, alongside Dr. Natalia Solarzano and Dr. Jeremy Thomas. This project was to explore and do some additional analysis on lightning data.
The files in this repository (apart from FCM.py) are outdated. To check out the updated version of WWLLN and GLM lightning graphing, please go [here](https://github.com/Squeemos/GLM_Processing)

### Contents
- FCM.py:
    - Contains an implementation of Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). This was used to compare against K-Means and DBSCAN on the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN)
    - It runs fairly slowly and requires data to be a pandas DataFrame
- IrmaGraphing.ipynb & LightningGraphing.ipynb:
    - Two files related to the graphing of WWLLN data
