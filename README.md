### [Expectation Maximization](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/ExpectationMaximization)
This project was to implement and work with with Gaussian Mixture Models and Expectation Maximization. Additional parts of this project were to write our own implementation of KMeans++

### [Fuzzy Sets](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/FuzzySets)
This project was a small implementation of Fuzzy Sets for a Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks course

### [Gaussian Naive Bayes](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/GaussianNaiveBayes)
This project was implementation Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) on the [Iris Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

### [ID3 Decision Tree](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/ID3DecisionTree)
This project was to implement an ID3 Decision Tree on a Tennis dataset and a Personal Loan dataset

### [LSGAN](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/LSGAN)
This project was an implementation of a Least-Squares Generative Adversarial Network (LSGAN) to generate cat faces from [this cat face dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spandan2/cats-faces-64x64-for-generative-models)
