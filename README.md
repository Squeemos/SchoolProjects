### [Shovel Knight Reinforcement Learning with Object Detection](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/ShovelKnightReinforcementLearning)
This project was during my Junior year at DigiPen. The overall plan was to create an OpenAI gym-style enviornment and then train an agent to play it. My approach was to use object detection for input and compare to using the traditional approach of the Nature CNN and compare learning efficiency.

### [Lightning Data Clustering](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/LightningDataClustering)
This project was during my Sophomore year at DigiPen. It involved working with two teammates alongside two advisors, Dr. Jeremy Thomas and Dr. Natalia Solarzano. The goal of the project was to see similar results from previous work, and then apply this solution (DBSCAN) to another data source.

### [LSGAN](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/LSGAN)
This project was an implementation of a Least-Squares Generative Adversarial Network (LSGAN) to generate cat faces from [this cat face dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spandan2/cats-faces-64x64-for-generative-models)

### [ID3 Decision Tree](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/ID3DecisionTree)
This assignment was to implement an ID3 Decision Tree on a Tennis dataset and a Personal Loan dataset.

### [Expectation Maximization](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/ExpectationMaximization)
This project was to implement and work with with Gaussian Mixture Models and Expectation Maximization. Additional parts of this project were to write our own implementation of KMeans++.

### [SVD with images](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/SingularValueDecomposition)
This project was a combination of using and exploring Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as well as it's application on images, and learning to use [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), a fairly popular Python dashboarding tool. The dataset used was the [Leeds Butterfly Dataset.](http://www.josiahwang.com/dataset/leedsbutterfly/)

### [Fuzzy Sets](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/FuzzySets)
This project was a small implementation of Fuzzy Sets for a Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks course.

### [Gaussian Naive Bayes](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/GaussianNaiveBayes)
This project was implementation Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) on the [Iris Data Set.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

### [Pokemon Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/PokemonDataAnalysis)
This project was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on [this Pokemon dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon).

### [SVM and Agglomerative Clustering](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/SVMandAgglomerativeClustering)
This assignment was to use and get familiar with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Agglomerative Clustering. Different kernels and different methods of agglomerative clustering were used and explored.

### [Spam Filter with Gaussian Naive Bayes](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/SpamFilter)
This assignment was to explore and use Gaussian Naive Bayes models to classify different emails as either "spam" or "ham" based on their contents. The emails were a compilation of unprocessed text files that needed to be cleaned and converted.

### [Stock Price Analysis](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/StockPriceAnalysis)
This simple project was to get more familiar with plotting techniques in [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/), [plotly](https://plotly.com/), and [mplfinance](https://github.com/matplotlib/mplfinance).

### [Time Series Analysis in R](https://github.com/Squeemos/SchoolProjects/tree/main/TimeSeriesAnalysis)
This project was to get familiar with R and time series analysis. Analysis and tests were done/run on [Delhi's climate](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data).
